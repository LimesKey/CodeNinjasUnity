# CodeNinjasUnity
Automated installer script for the Code Ninjas Unity Manual and Assets

Place the PS1 file on a USB stick then on every laptop you want to run it on, plug in the USB stick, go to the USB drive and right click the installer file and press "Run with Powershell". The code was written quickly and is very bad and embarrassing - but it works.
